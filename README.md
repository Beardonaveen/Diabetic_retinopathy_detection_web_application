# Diabetic_retinopathy_detection_web_application
This project uses TensorFlow and Flask to create a web application that classifies images as 'Infected' or 'Uninfected'. Users upload an image, and the model, trained on labeled data, processes the image to predict its category. The app then displays the prediction along with the accuracy, providing a simple interface for real-time images
